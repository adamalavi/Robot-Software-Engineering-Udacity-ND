## Overview  
In this project you will utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments. Here are the steps to learn several aspects of robotic software engineering with a focus on ROS:  
* Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world  
* Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot  
* Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results  
## Prerequisites/Dependencies  
* Gazebo >= 7.0  
* ROS Kinetic  
* ROS navigation package  
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation
```
* ROS map_server package  
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-map-server
```
* ROS move_base package  
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-move-base
```
* ROS amcl package  
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-amcl
```

## Run the project  
* Clone this repository
* Open the repository and make  
```
cd /home/workspace/Project3/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```
* Launch my_robot in Gazebo to load both the world and plugins  
```
roslaunch my_robot world.launch
```  
* Launch amcl node  
```
roslaunch my_robot amcl.launch
```  
* Testing  
You have two options to control your robot while it localize itself here:  
  * Send navigation goal via RViz  
  * Send move command via teleop package.  
Navigate your robot, observe its performance and tune your parameters for AMCL.  

**Option 1: Send `2D Navigation Goal`**  
Your first option would be sending a `2D Nav Goal` from RViz. The `move_base` will try to navigate your robot based on the localization. Based on the new observation and the odometry, the robot will further perform the localization.  
Click the `2D Nav Goal` button in the toolbar, then click and drag on the map to send the goal to the robot. It will start moving and localize itself in the process.  
**Option 2: Use `teleop` Node**  
You could also use teleop node to control your robot and observe it localize itself in the environment.  
Open another terminal and launch the `teleop` script:  
```
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```
You could control your robot by keyboard commands now.
