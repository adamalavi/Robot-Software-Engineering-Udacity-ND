# Robot-Software-Engineering-Udacity-ND
Udacity's nano-degree on robotics software development that includes various projects on ROS and Gazebo to learn how to intensively work with ROS packages and simulations.

## Project 1 - Build my world
Build a Gazebo world that includes working with the model editor and building editor to make custom models and buildings and writing Plug-Ins.

## Project 2 - Go chase it!
Build a model of two wheeled robot using the URDF format and write various nodes for ROS in C++ such that whenever a white ball is present in the camera's field of view, the robot will chase it.

## Project 3 - Where am I?
Use the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localisation package in ROS to know the location of your robot as it moves around in your world.

## Project 4 - Map my world
Use Rtabmp_ros package to perform SLAM and move a robot around an environment and accurately map it to create 2D and 3D maps.

## Project 5 - Home service robot
Simulate a robot that travels from a start point to a pick up zone, simulates the pick up of a virtual object and then navigates its way back to the drop zone.
